    To start Sidekiq when the server boots up, we need to create a symlink. In order to do so, run the below command.
    
    bundle exec sidekiq sudo systemctl enable sidekiq.service
    To start the Sidekiq service.
    
    sudo service sidekiq start systemctl {start,stop,restart} sidekiq
    You can check the system log for errors.
    
    sudo cat /var/log/syslog
    Check if Sidekiq started by
    
    sudo ps aux | grep sidekiq
    If the Sidekiq is running you can see something likeâ€¦
    
    user 2609 0.7 3.3 1352776 136960 ? Ssl 06:18 0:15 sidekiq 5.2.7 application-name[0 of 25 busy]
